  "Background": {
    "paragraph1": "This project is essentially a statistical analysis of some medical research that I have done during a sabbatical period supported by savings. The research itself comprises of a hypothesis and a wealth of supporting evidence including 289 cases. The cases, or \"events\" as I call them, each have about 70 data points and this site is intended to graphically display certain supporting evidence, provide methods of challenging that and exploring how wrong I can be (bias is real) and also, give the user the chance to interact themselves, either to challenge the data or to explore it themselves.",
    "paragraph2-1": "I noticed, investigated and and may have discovered something new about the brainstem under certain conditions and this website is all about looking at that data from different angles. ",
    "paragraph2Link": "",
    "paragraph2-2": "I did this all myself and it even delayed my job searching; however, it needs verification from medically trained folk.",
    "paragraph3": "The medical research is real, the events are real and each one represents the experience of a real person, many of whom, around 90, have not fared so well and cannot be said to be fully better, if they ever will be. The site is purposefully genericised for the sake of those folk and because my hypothesis has stood up my own attempts to discredit it but has never been validated by an expert who would be accepted generally as capable of speaking on such matters."
  },

  "Motivation": {
    "paragraph4": "I have been a bit nerdy about medical things for a long time, since a long family illness saw me in hospitals as a relative while a child, then a book by Ben Goldacre, and a natural curiosity that means it's been a base that's gradually built for years. This time I really quite casually looked at something that was curious and over a series of notable events and more focused, full-time work, building up to nine months, I may have made the discovery that something not so well understood is more complex than we thought and I can even see useful avenues for this knowledge in society, though, that has been complicated as the nuances emerged (see below). All this possibility of discovery, breakthroughs, connections, visualisations and learning, way outside my professional field, were both exciting and kept that motivation going and going, longer indeed than it should have, give neither wage nor benefit for my efforts.",
    "paragraph5": "On top the web work and the medical research there is also a decidedly complex and nuanced web of medical ethics problems which I identified and have ideas to mitigate in some cases. The ethics comes in because the problem would best be thought of as a type of poisoning, a deliberately broad choice of term (I will remain secretive with the details until some other expertise has been consulted) but a notable choice because it is something that can be done maliciously by a predatory individual to a vulnerable individual and it is very dangerous. These are not light spaces to deal with, and when they group, overlap and multiply, that gets challenging. Challenging is good, and when it's all put together, this has been the most challenging problem I've tackled in my life, but the suffering of people "

  "Testing": {
    "paragraph7": "StoryBook is great. It allows testing by mimicking eyes on screen, using humans and can be done by developer, reviewer, QA and anyone else. It can be remotely hosted, so they don't need to be here either. With testing you want to mimic the real system as closely as possible so it makes sense to unit test a util function, you use a computer to test what a computer will use. With the screen based UI stuff the real system is human eyes looking at a screen, hence my feelings about StoryBook.",
    "paragraph8": "Visual component unit tests are a bit of waste of time anyway, they're brittle and often rather high in number (N button sizes in N states, for example) plus all you can test is that the right prop went in - catching prop “disabled” is set to true isn't going to catch someone deleting the disabled button styles by mistake.",
    "paragraph9": "More complex components and any util functions are tested. Util functions are used to keep components more simple and improve testability too.",
    "paragraph10": "Full integration testing is done with a light touch and for some edge cases (decided as and when). If we need to log in for example because it's a real, full website test, then the time quickly mounts up, a test might take two mins because it would take the user ten to log in, navigate, fill the form, submit so we need to be careful. Also we can find situations where it all failed because the internet broke."
